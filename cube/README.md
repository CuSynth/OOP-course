# Rubik's cube
Project for the first part of OOP course.

Simple rubik's cube implementation with console graphics.
You can:
- get a random destroying algorithm for your cube
- solve your cube
- play with an interractive mode in which you can get random sequence for cube destruction and immediately redraw it.

In solution mode you can enter your cube using console/file or interractive mode. There is an "in.txt" file with pattern of destroyed cube for test.

So, the solution mode is represented here:

![partially solved cube](part_solved.png "partially solved cube")
![solved cube](solved.png "solved cube")

Interactive entering mode:
![interactive mode](interactive.png "interactive mode")

Destroying mode:
![destroying mode](destroy.png "destroying mode")

Menu and help list:
![menu](menu.png "menu")
![help](help.png "help")
